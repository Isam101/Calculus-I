📘 Limits & Continuity — Summary (GitHub Version)

Limits describe what value a function approaches as the input gets close to a certain number. Formally:

lim ⁡𝑥→𝑎
𝑓(𝑥)=𝐿 


This means as x approaches a, the output of f(x) approaches L.
Important notes:

a does not need to be in the domain of the function

The function does not need to equal the limit, only approach it

Example: piecewise functions can have different behaviors on each interval — the limit depends on the values approached from both sides.
