✅ Rational Functions – Limits of the form 0/0

When you plug in the limit value and get 0/0, it means the function is indeterminate and can usually be simplified.

Steps to solve 0/0 rational limits

1) Factor the numerator
2) Factor the denominator
3) Identify the problematic factor — the one that becomes zero at the limit value
4) Cancel that factor
5) Evaluate the limit again
